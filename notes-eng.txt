	Network Simulation Project Notes
	
	
General Description :

	The user opens the application window. The window is a terminal
	window where the user can enter some commands. Using these commands,
	the user can interact with a server that responds to the user's
	requests. This way, the user might use different apps that, actually,
	support multiple users.


General Requirements :

	- For a given application, ability to use this application by many
	clients and so that a server would manage the app also.


Specific Requirements :

	- Start with a single server. Let its command family call "srv".
	Then, we have these basic commands:
		- srv register <username>
		- srv login <username>
		- srv logout
		- srv signout/leave/unregister
	To implement using the server by multiple users independently, we
	should make the server running in a separate thread and use a dispatcher
	that will manage user requests and server responses through some queus.
	- [UI] When pressing Up/Down arrow keys, user should see commands he've
	entered before;
	
	
Bugs :
	- when the caret in the middle of the line being typed, and we press
	Enter, then the behaviour is incorrect;
